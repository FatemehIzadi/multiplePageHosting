                  <h5 class="card-title">The Women of This World' by Ann Beattie</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">It's hardly autumn without escalating tensions at a pre-Thanksgiving dinner party, now, is it? "The Women of the World" follows a woman named Dale as she prepares and serves dinner for her husband, his stepfather, and his stepfather's girlfriend. And if your own family dinners often involve gaslighting and not-so-subtle digs from the more "traditional" men in your family, then this is the chilling, rage-inducing short story for you.

                  <p class="card-text">October is sitting in the chair, leading his compatriots, in this lovely, strange tale about the months of the year personified. It's delightfully autumnal and more then a little upsetting (in true Neil Gaiman fashion), blending that comfortable feeling of sitting by the fire with ghosts with the story of a young October runaway searching for a safe haven.
